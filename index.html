            <h2 class="font">Here's a history of his Origin:</h2>
            <p>There are two theories regarding Shah Mir's origin. Some Persian chronicles of Kashmir describe Shah Mir
                as a descendant of the rulers of Swat.[a] Historian A. Q. Rafiqi thinks it more likely that he was a
                descendant of Persian or Turkic immigrants to Swat.[2] It has also been suggested that he belonged to a
                Sufi or Qadiri family.[3] Waqur Shah was his grandfather or ancestor</p>

            <p class="font"><i>Shah Mir arrived in Kashmir in 1313 along with his family,
                    during the reign of Suhadeva (1301-1320), whose service he entered.
                    In subsequent years, through his tact and ability Shah Mir rose to prominence
                    and became one of the most important personalities of his time.</i>
